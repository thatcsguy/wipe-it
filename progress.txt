## setup-001 - Project Setup Complete

- Created package.json w/ express, socket.io, typescript, esbuild, ts-node-dev
- tsconfig.json: target ES2020, module commonjs, server+shared
- tsconfig.client.json: target ES2020, module ESNext, client+shared
- esbuild.config.js bundles client to public/js/main.js
- Created placeholder files in src/server, src/client, src/shared
- Also created directory structure (setup-002 prereq)

Files: package.json, tsconfig.json, tsconfig.client.json, esbuild.config.js, src/*/

## shared-001 - Shared Types Complete

- Defined all interfaces: PlayerState, GameState, PlayerInput, InputKeys
- Defined all constants: TICK_RATE=60, BROADCAST_RATE=20, PLAYER_SPEED=200, PLAYER_RADIUS=20, ARENA_WIDTH=800, ARENA_HEIGHT=600, MAX_PLAYERS=4
- Build verified: npm run build passes

Files: src/shared/types.ts

## server-001 - Express Server Complete

- Express + Socket.IO server w/ http.createServer
- Serves static files from public/
- Listens on PORT env or 3000
- Basic socket connection logging (placeholder for server-004)
- Created minimal index.html for testing
- Verified: npm run dev starts, Playwright confirms 200 response

Files: src/server/index.ts, public/index.html

## server-002 - Player Class Complete

- Player class w/ id, name, x, y, color, lastProcessedInput
- processInput() applies WASD movement w/ delta time, normalizes diagonal
- Position clamped to arena bounds (PLAYER_RADIUS to WIDTH/HEIGHT - PLAYER_RADIUS)
- toState() returns PlayerState for serialization
- Build verified: npm run build passes

Files: src/server/player.ts

## server-003 - Game Class Complete

- Game class manages players in Map<socketId, Player>
- Color pool: 4 colors, assigned on join, returned on leave
- addPlayer() returns null if >=4 players (MAX_PLAYERS check)
- removePlayer() returns color to pool
- Physics loop at 60Hz via setInterval, processes queued inputs
- Broadcast loop at 20Hz emits 'state' event w/ GameState
- inputQueues stores per-player input buffers for tick processing
- Build verified, server starts correctly

Files: src/server/game.ts

## server-004 - Socket.IO Events Complete

- Imported Game class into index.ts, created/started game instance
- 'join' event: calls game.addPlayer(), emits joinResponse w/ success+playerId or error
- 'input' event: calls game.queueInput() for processing in tick loop
- 'disconnect' event: calls game.removePlayer()
- State broadcast already includes lastProcessedInput (from server-003)
- Verified w/ Playwright: join works, 5th player rejected, input processed (seq=42), disconnect removes player

Files: src/server/index.ts

## client-001 - HTML Canvas & Modal Complete

- Created index.html w/ canvas#game 800x600
- Modal overlay w/ name input, join button, error message area
- Script tag loads /js/main.js as ES module
- Linked /css/style.css (file to be created in client-002)
- Verified w/ Playwright: all elements present, input visible

Files: public/index.html

## client-002 - CSS Styling Complete

- Created style.css w/ flexbox centering for body
- Canvas: block display, 2px solid border (#4a4a6a)
- Modal: absolute position overlaying canvas, rgba(0,0,0,0.7) bg
- .hidden class sets display:none for modal hide on join
- Dark theme: #1a1a2e bg, #16213e canvas, #e0e0e0 text
