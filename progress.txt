## HP-001 + HP-002: Hitpoints foundation
- Added MAX_HP=100 constant to shared/types.ts
- Added hp:number field to PlayerState interface
- Server Player class: hp property (init 100), takeDamage(amount) clamps to 0, toState() includes hp
- Verified via Playwright: player state shows hp:100
- Files: src/shared/types.ts, src/server/player.ts
- Note: HP-001 and HP-002 done together - toState() requires hp field so both needed for compilation

## HP-003: Health bar rendering
- Added getHealthColor(hpPercent) helper - green >50%, yellow 25-50%, red <25%
- Added drawHealthBar(x, y, hp) - 40px wide, 6px tall, positioned above circle
- Updated drawPlayer and drawPlayerAt to include health bar rendering
- Updated drawPlayerAt signature to accept hp param
- Name text moved up (y - PLAYER_RADIUS - 10) to accommodate health bar
- Verified via Playwright: green bar visible above circle, below name
- Files: src/client/renderer.ts
