## TIMELINE-001 to TIMELINE-004: at() + runTimeline() infrastructure

Completed: types.ts interface + script-runner.ts implementation

Key decisions:
- at(time, fn) just pushes to timeline array, no validation
- runTimeline() re-sorts each iteration for dynamic scheduling support
- waitTime computed as entry.time - getElapsedTime(), skipped if <= 0
- fn awaited to support async callbacks

Files:
- src/server/encounters/types.ts: added at(), runTimeline() to ScriptRunner interface
- src/server/encounters/script-runner.ts: added timeline array, at(), runTimeline() methods

Build passes. Sub-script isolation via run() already works - new ScriptRunnerImpl gets empty timeline by default.

## TIMELINE-005: Dynamic scheduling test

Verified via Playwright E2E test.

Test script: schedules fn1@T=0, fn2@T=2000. fn1 dynamically schedules fn3@T=1000.
Expected order: fn1 -> fn3 -> fn2. Confirmed via mechanic spawn positions:
- T=24ms: chariot at (160,160) = fn1 (top-left)
- T=1027ms: chariot at (400,400) = fn3 (center, dynamically scheduled)
- T=2028ms: chariot at (640,640) = fn2 (bottom-right)

Files:
- src/server/encounters/scripts/tests/dynamic-scheduling-test.ts (new)
- src/server/index.ts: added admin:runDynamicSchedulingTest handler
- src/client/admin.ts: added emitRunDynamicSchedulingTest()
