## TIMELINE-001 to TIMELINE-004: at() + runTimeline() infrastructure

Completed: types.ts interface + script-runner.ts implementation

Key decisions:
- at(time, fn) just pushes to timeline array, no validation
- runTimeline() re-sorts each iteration for dynamic scheduling support
- waitTime computed as entry.time - getElapsedTime(), skipped if <= 0
- fn awaited to support async callbacks

Files:
- src/server/encounters/types.ts: added at(), runTimeline() to ScriptRunner interface
- src/server/encounters/script-runner.ts: added timeline array, at(), runTimeline() methods

Build passes. Sub-script isolation via run() already works - new ScriptRunnerImpl gets empty timeline by default.
