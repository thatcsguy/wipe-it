TRIGGER-001: Added triggerAt?: number to all 8 MechanicParams union types
- chariot, spread, tether, tower, lineAoe, conalAoe, radialKnockback, linearKnockback
- Build passes
- File: src/server/encounters/types.ts

TRIGGER-002: ScriptRunnerImpl tracks script start time
- Added private field scriptStartTime: number
- Constructor sets this.scriptStartTime = Date.now()
- Added getElapsedTime() helper returning Date.now() - scriptStartTime
- Build passes
- File: src/server/encounters/script-runner.ts

TRIGGER-003: computeTiming() helper for triggerAt conversion
- Method signature: computeTiming(triggerAt, timing, defaultTiming, timingName) => number
- Returns defaultTiming when both undefined
- Returns timing when defined, triggerAt undefined
- Computes triggerAt - getElapsedTime() when triggerAt defined
- Also implements TRIGGER-004 and TRIGGER-005 error handling:
  - Throws "Cannot specify both triggerAt and {timingName}" when both defined
  - Throws with triggerAt/elapsed info when computed delay is negative
- Build passes
- File: src/server/encounters/script-runner.ts

TRIGGER-006: All 8 spawn() cases use computeTiming()
- chariot, spread, tether, tower, lineAoe, conalAoe use computeTiming for 'duration'
- radialKnockback, linearKnockback use computeTiming for 'delay'
- Build passes
- File: src/server/encounters/script-runner.ts

TRIGGER-006a: runner.run() creates new ScriptRunnerImpl for sub-scripts
- Changed run() to create `new ScriptRunnerImpl(this.game)` instead of reusing `this`
- Sub-script's T=0 is now when run() is called, not parent's start time
- Verified via Playwright: parent waits 3000ms, sub-script spawns with triggerAt:1500 succeeds
- Added test script: src/server/encounters/scripts/tests/scoped-timeline-test.ts
- Admin handler: socket.on('admin:runScopedTimelineTest')
- Build passes
- File: src/server/encounters/script-runner.ts, src/server/index.ts

TRIGGER-008: E2E test verifies triggerAt synchronizes mechanics to absolute time
- Test: spawns chariot at T=0 with triggerAt:3000, spawns second at T=1500 with triggerAt:3000
- Result: both resolve within 1ms of each other despite 1513ms spawn delta
- Mechanic 1 duration: 3025ms, Mechanic 2 duration: 1513ms - both resolve at T~3000
- Test script: src/server/encounters/scripts/tests/trigger-at-test.ts
- Admin handler: socket.on('admin:runTriggerAtTest')
- Client method: __adminTest.emitRunTriggerAtTest()
- Build passes
- Files: src/server/encounters/scripts/tests/trigger-at-test.ts, src/server/index.ts, src/client/admin.ts
