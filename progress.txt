## ROOT-001 + ROOT-003: Add rooted type and icon mapping

- Added 'rooted' to StatusEffectType union in src/shared/types.ts
- Added rooted icon path to STATUS_ICONS in src/server/statusEffect.ts
- Combined because STATUS_ICONS is Record<StatusEffectType, string> - requires all types

Files: src/shared/types.ts, src/server/statusEffect.ts

Note: ROOT-002 (asset download) still needed before icon displays
