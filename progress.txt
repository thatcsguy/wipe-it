TOWER-001 (types) - DONE
- Added 'tower' to MechanicType union
- Created TowerMechanicState interface with all required fields
- Created TowerResolutionEvent interface with x,y for explosion positioning
- Added TowerMechanicState to MechanicState union
- File: src/shared/types.ts
- Build passes

TOWER-002 (server) - DONE
- Created src/server/mechanics/tower.ts implementing BaseMechanic
- Constructor takes all params: id, x, y, radius, startTime, endTime, requiredPlayers, failureEffects, successEffects
- tick() empty, isExpired() checks now >= endTime
- resolve() counts players in radius, applies successEffects to inside players if met, failureEffects to ALL players if not
- Returns TowerResolutionEvent with mechanicId, success, playersInside, required, x, y
- Updated types.ts to include TowerResolutionEvent in MechanicResolutionResult union
- Files: src/server/mechanics/tower.ts, src/server/mechanics/types.ts
- Build passes

TOWER-003 (server integration) - DONE
- Imported TowerMechanic in src/server/game.ts
- Added spawnTower(x, y, radius, duration, requiredPlayers, failureEffects, successEffects) method
- spawnTower generates unique id, calculates startTime/endTime from now + duration
- Updated resolution callback to detect TowerResolutionEvent (via 'required' field) and emit 'tower:resolved'
- TowerMechanic already exported from tower.ts
- File: src/server/game.ts
- Build passes
