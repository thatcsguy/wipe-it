- Created src/server/encounters/types.ts
- Exports: Context, Selector, MechanicResult, Script, MechanicParams, ScriptRunner
- MechanicParams = discriminated union for all mechanic types with optional defaults
- Build passes

ENC-002: Basic targeting selectors
- Created src/server/encounters/targeting.ts
- all(): filters hp > 0
- random(n): Fisher-Yates shuffle, handles n > players.length
- closest(point): Euclidean distance, returns single-element array
- furthest(point): Euclidean distance, returns single-element array
- All return Selector functions (not results)
- Build passes

ENC-003: Advanced targeting selectors
- nClosest(n, point): sorts by distance ascending, takes first n
- nFurthest(n, point): sorts by distance descending, takes first n
- withStatus(effect): filters players whose statusEffects includes effect
- withoutStatus(effect): filters players whose statusEffects excludes effect
- All handle edge cases (empty living players, n > players.length)
- Build passes
