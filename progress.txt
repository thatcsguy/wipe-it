BUBBLE-001 + BUBBLE-003: Added 'bubbled' and 'bubble-warning' to StatusEffectType, added icon paths
- Files: src/shared/types.ts, src/server/statusEffect.ts
- Both use '/assets/bubble-warning_icon.png' (same icon per PRD)
- BUBBLE-003 required for BUBBLE-001 to compile (Record<StatusEffectType> constraint)

BUBBLE-004: Added isBubbled() function to localStatus.ts
- Pattern matches isRooted() exactly
- Also exposed in __localStatusTest for testing
- File: src/client/localStatus.ts

BUBBLE-005 + BUBBLE-006 + BUBBLE-007: Bubbled movement blocking (client + server)
- Client: import isBubbled, check in applyInput() + reconcile() after isRooted checks
- Server: check for 'bubbled' in processInput() after rooted check
- Key: applyKnockback() has NO bubbled check - knockback still works on bubbled players
- Verified via Playwright: WASD blocked while bubbled, knockback still applies
- Files: src/client/network.ts, src/server/player.ts

BUBBLE-008 + BUBBLE-009: Visual bubble rendering
- drawBubble(): translucent cyan circle (r=48), offset up to encompass player+name
- 3D effect: highlight arc upper-left, small shine dot
- Soft white/light border (rgba 200,230,255,0.6)
- Called in render loop BEFORE drawPlayer/drawPlayerAt when player has 'bubbled' status
- Verified via Playwright: bubble visual renders around bubbled player
- File: src/client/renderer.ts
