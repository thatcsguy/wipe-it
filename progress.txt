TETHER-001 (Types) - DONE
- Added TetherEndpoint discriminated union (player | point)
- Added TetherMechanicState interface w/ all required fields
- Added 'tether' to MechanicType, TetherMechanicState to MechanicState union
- File: src/shared/types.ts

TETHER-002 (Server - tether.ts) - DONE
- Created TetherMechanic class implementing BaseMechanic
- Constructor takes: endpointA, endpointB, requiredDistance, damage, duration (generates own id like other mechanics)
- resolve() resolves endpoint positions (player lookup or point x/y), calculates Euclidean distance
- Applies damage to connected players only when distance < requiredDistance
- toState() returns properly typed TetherMechanicState
- File: src/server/mechanics/tether.ts

TETHER-003 (Server - admin handlers) - DONE
- Added spawnTether() method to Game class
- Added 'pointTethers' handler: creates 1 tether per player to (ARENA_WIDTH/2, 0)
- Added 'playerTethers' handler: picks 2 random players, creates 1 tether between them
- Both use: requiredDistance=ARENA_WIDTH*0.75 (600), duration=3000ms, damage=100
- Verified w/ Playwright: point tethers create correct endpoint at top center
- Verified w/ Playwright: player tethers create 1 tether between 2 different players
- Files: src/server/game.ts, src/server/index.ts

TETHER-004 (Client - admin buttons) - DONE
- Added #spawn-point-tethers-btn and #spawn-player-tethers-btn to admin panel
- Added click handlers emitting admin:spawnMechanic w/ type='pointTethers' and 'playerTethers'
- Added __adminTest helpers for programmatic testing
- Verified w/ Playwright: buttons exist, clicking them creates correct tether mechanics
- Files: public/index.html, src/client/admin.ts

TETHER-005 (Client - tether rendering) - DONE
- Added renderTether() fn in src/client/mechanics.ts
- Unstretched (distance < requiredDistance): 6px pink (#ff66aa) line w/ chevrons pointing toward closer endpoint
- Stretched (distance >= requiredDistance): 2px orange (#ffcc00) line w/ shadowBlur glow
- Chevron spacing scales proportionally w/ distance
- Uses getEndpointPosition() helper for player/point lookup
- Verified w/ Playwright: pink line when close, orange glow when far, transitions correctly
- File: src/client/mechanics.ts
