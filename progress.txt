## HP-001 + HP-002: Hitpoints foundation
- Added MAX_HP=100 constant to shared/types.ts
- Added hp:number field to PlayerState interface
- Server Player class: hp property (init 100), takeDamage(amount) clamps to 0, toState() includes hp
- Verified via Playwright: player state shows hp:100
- Files: src/shared/types.ts, src/server/player.ts
- Note: HP-001 and HP-002 done together - toState() requires hp field so both needed for compilation

## HP-003: Health bar rendering
- Added getHealthColor(hpPercent) helper - green >50%, yellow 25-50%, red <25%
- Added drawHealthBar(x, y, hp) - 40px wide, 6px tall, positioned above circle
- Updated drawPlayer and drawPlayerAt to include health bar rendering
- Updated drawPlayerAt signature to accept hp param
- Name text moved up (y - PLAYER_RADIUS - 10) to accommodate health bar
- Verified via Playwright: green bar visible above circle, below name
- Files: src/client/renderer.ts

## MECH-001: Mechanics type definitions
- Created src/server/mechanics/types.ts
- Effect interface: type ('damage') + amount
- BaseMechanic interface: id, tick(now), isExpired(now), resolve(players), toState()
- Also included MechanicState interface (needed by toState return type)
- Files: src/server/mechanics/types.ts

## MECH-002: MechanicManager class
- Created src/server/mechanics/manager.ts
- MechanicManager class with private mechanics Map<string, BaseMechanic>
- add(mechanic) - registers mechanic by id
- tick(now, players) - calls tick on all, resolves + removes expired
- getStates() - returns MechanicState[] for broadcast
- Files: src/server/mechanics/manager.ts

## MECH-003: MechanicState in shared types
- Moved MechanicState interface from server/mechanics/types.ts to shared/types.ts
- Updated GameState to include mechanics: MechanicState[] array
- Server mechanics/types.ts now imports + re-exports MechanicState from shared
- Updated server/game.ts broadcast() to include empty mechanics array
- Updated client/game.ts initial state to include empty mechanics array
- Verified via Playwright: GameState.mechanics exists and is empty array
- Files: src/shared/types.ts, src/server/mechanics/types.ts, src/server/game.ts, src/client/game.ts

## MECH-004: MechanicManager integration
- Import MechanicManager in Game class
- Added private mechanicManager property instantiated inline
- tick() now gets Date.now() and calls mechanicManager.tick(now, this.players)
- broadcast() uses mechanicManager.getStates() instead of empty array
- Verified via Playwright: client receives mechanics array in GameState
- Files: src/server/game.ts

## CHARIOT-001: ChariotMechanic class
- Created src/server/mechanics/chariot.ts
- ChariotMechanic implements BaseMechanic interface
- Constructor: x, y, radius, duration, effects[] - generates unique id, calculates endTime
- tick(): no-op (chariot just waits for expiration)
- isExpired(now): returns true when now >= endTime
- resolve(players): iterates all players, calculates distance from center, applies damage effects if within radius
- toState(): returns MechanicState with type='chariot'
- Files: src/server/mechanics/chariot.ts

## CHARIOT-002: spawnChariot method
- Added spawnChariot(x, y, radius, duration, effects) method to Game class
- Creates ChariotMechanic with provided params, adds to mechanicManager
- Imported ChariotMechanic and Effect types in game.ts
- Files: src/server/game.ts

## RENDER-001: Client mechanic rendering
- Created src/client/mechanics.ts
- renderMechanics(ctx, mechanics[], serverTime) - iterates mechanics, dispatches by type
- renderChariot(ctx, mechanic, serverTime) - orange-yellow (#ff9f40) transparent circle
- Inner circle expands based on progress = (serverTime - startTime) / (endTime - startTime)
- Outer circle alpha 0.3, inner alpha 0.5
- Exposed __mechanicsTest for testing
- Files: src/client/mechanics.ts

## RENDER-002: Mechanic rendering integration
- renderer.ts: import renderMechanics from mechanics.ts, add MechanicState import
- render() signature: added optional mechanics[] and serverTime params
- Calls renderMechanics(ctx, mechanics, serverTime) before drawing players
- game.ts: pass currentGameState.mechanics and currentGameState.timestamp to render()
- Verified via Playwright: mechanics array + timestamp available, __mechanicsTest.renderMechanics exists
- Files: src/client/renderer.ts, src/client/game.ts

## ADMIN-001: Admin panel HTML structure
- Added game-wrapper div to hold game-container + admin-panel side-by-side via flexbox
- Admin panel: div#admin-panel with h3 "Admin" heading + button#spawn-chariot-btn
- CSS: .game-wrapper flex layout, .admin-panel dark bg (#0f0f1a), styled button
- Verified via Playwright: panel visible to right of canvas with Spawn Chariot button
- Files: public/index.html, public/css/style.css
