BUBBLE-001 + BUBBLE-003: Added 'bubbled' and 'bubble-warning' to StatusEffectType, added icon paths
- Files: src/shared/types.ts, src/server/statusEffect.ts
- Both use '/assets/bubble-warning_icon.png' (same icon per PRD)
- BUBBLE-003 required for BUBBLE-001 to compile (Record<StatusEffectType> constraint)

BUBBLE-004: Added isBubbled() function to localStatus.ts
- Pattern matches isRooted() exactly
- Also exposed in __localStatusTest for testing
- File: src/client/localStatus.ts
