STATUS-001: COMPLETE
- Added StatusEffectType union w/ 'vulnerability'
- Added StatusEffectState interface (type, iconPath, startTime, duration, playerId)
- Added statusEffects[] to PlayerState, GameState
- Added Effect type w/ damage and status variants
- Updated player.ts toState(), game.ts broadcast(), client/game.ts default state
Files: src/shared/types.ts, src/server/player.ts, src/server/game.ts, src/client/game.ts

STATUS-002: COMPLETE
- Created StatusEffect class w/ properties: id, type, playerId, startTime, duration, ongoingEffects, expirationEffects
- tick() applies ongoing effects to player
- isExpired() checks now >= startTime + duration
- onExpire() applies expiration effects
- toState() returns StatusEffectState w/ iconPath from STATUS_ICONS lookup
Files: src/server/statusEffect.ts

STATUS-003: COMPLETE
- Created StatusEffectManager class w/ Map<string, StatusEffect> storage
- add(status) stores StatusEffect by id
- tick(now, players) iterates statuses, applies ongoing effects, removes expired (calls onExpire first)
- getStates() returns StatusEffectState[] for broadcast
- remove(id) deletes status by id
- Added helper getStatusesForPlayer(playerId) for STATUS-005 vulnerability check
Files: src/server/statusEffectManager.ts

STATUS-004: COMPLETE
- Added statusEffectManager property to Game class
- tick() now calls statusEffectManager.tick(now, this.players)
- broadcast() includes statusEffectManager.getStates() in state
- Verified w/ Playwright: game state has statusEffects array
Files: src/server/game.ts

STATUS-005: COMPLETE
- Player.takeDamage() checks for vulnerability via statusEffectManager.getStatusesForPlayer()
- Damage multiplied by 10 when vulnerability active
- Player has setStatusEffectManager() method, called in Game.addPlayer()
- Added getStatusEffectManager() and getPlayers() to Game for testing/future use
- Added admin:applyVulnerability socket event for testing
- Verified w/ Playwright: player took 250 dmg (25*10) with vuln vs 25 without
Files: src/server/player.ts, src/server/game.ts, src/server/index.ts

STATUS-006: COMPLETE
- Created statusEffects.ts w/ renderStatusEffects() function
- Icon caching w/ getIcon(), fallback red square while loading
- Icons rendered centered above player (y - PLAYER_RADIUS - 28)
- Created vulnerability.svg icon (red shield w/ down arrow)
- Integrated into renderer.ts render() - status icons drawn after all players for z-order
- Uses player's actual position (local predicted, interpolated, or server)
- Verified w/ Playwright: vulnerability icon visible above player after admin:applyVulnerability
Files: src/client/statusEffects.ts, src/client/renderer.ts, public/images/vulnerability.svg

SPREAD-001: COMPLETE
- Added MechanicType union: 'chariot' | 'spread'
- Created ChariotMechanicState interface (refactored from old MechanicState)
- Created SpreadMechanicState interface w/ targetPlayerId, no x/y (position from player)
- MechanicState now discriminated union of both
- Updated client mechanics.ts to use ChariotMechanicState for type safety
Files: src/shared/types.ts, src/client/mechanics.ts

SPREAD-002: COMPLETE
- Created SpreadMechanic class w/ properties: id, targetPlayerId, radius, startTime, endTime, effects
- tick(now) is no-op (position from player)
- isExpired(now) returns now >= endTime
- resolve(players, statusManager) finds target player, damages all in radius, applies vulnerability (1000ms)
- toState() returns SpreadMechanicState w/ targetPlayerId
- Updated BaseMechanic interface: resolve() now accepts optional statusManager
- Updated types.ts to re-export Effect from shared/types (supports damage + status variants)
Files: src/server/mechanics/spread.ts, src/server/mechanics/types.ts

SPREAD-003: COMPLETE
- Updated MechanicManager.tick() to accept statusEffectManager as 3rd parameter
- tick() now passes statusManager to mechanic.resolve(players, statusManager)
- Updated Game.tick() to pass this.statusEffectManager to mechanicManager.tick()
- Enables SpreadMechanic (and future mechanics) to apply status effects on resolve
Files: src/server/mechanics/manager.ts, src/server/game.ts
