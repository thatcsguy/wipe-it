## TOAST-001 - Toast container in HTML
- Added <div id="action-log" class="action-log"></div> to index.html
- Added CSS: fixed position bottom-left, flex column, pointer-events:none so it won't block clicks
- Verified #action-log exists in DOM via Playwright
- Files: public/index.html, public/css/style.css

## TOAST-002 - Toast module with showToast function

- Appends .toast div to #action-log, auto-removes after 3s with fade-out animation
- Max 5 toasts enforced (oldest removed first)
- Exposed __toastTest.showToast on window for testing
- Added toast CSS styles (slide-in animation, fade-out on removal)
- Imported toast module in main.ts to initialize
- Validated: toast creation, auto-removal after 3s, max 5 limit
- Files: src/client/toast.ts, src/client/main.ts, public/css/style.css

## TOAST-003 - Admin actions trigger toast notifications
- Imported showToast in admin.ts, added calls after each emit
- Chariot: "Spawned chariot", Spreads: "Spawned spreads", Heal: "Healed all players"

## DEBUG-001 - Debug panel container with ?debug=1 toggle
- Added <div id="debug-panel" class="debug-panel hidden"> to index.html
- CSS: fixed right side, dark bg, scrollable, z-index 900
- main.ts checks URLSearchParams for debug=1, removes hidden class if present
- Verified: panel hidden without param, visible with ?debug=1
- Files: public/index.html, public/css/style.css, src/client/main.ts

## DEBUG-002 - debugPanel.ts module with initDebugPanel and updateDebugPanel
- Created src/client/debugPanel.ts
- initDebugPanel() sets up panel structure with Players/Mechanics sections
- updateDebugPanel(gameState, localPlayerId) called each frame from game loop
- Players: .debug-player with data-player-id, data-hp, data-x, data-y, health bar
- Mechanics: .debug-mechanic with data-mechanic-id, data-type, data-expires
- Exposed __debugTest API (show, hide, isVisible, getElement) for INTEGRATION-002
- main.ts imports and calls initDebugPanel() on startup
- game.ts imports and calls updateDebugPanel() in gameLoop after render
- Validated: player attrs update, mechanic attrs appear/disappear, __debugTest API works
- Files: src/client/debugPanel.ts, src/client/main.ts, src/client/game.ts

## DEBUG-003 & DEBUG-004 - Debug panel player/mechanic styling
- Added CSS for .debug-player, .debug-player-info, .debug-player-name, .debug-player-pos
- Added .debug-health-bar and .debug-health-fill with green-red gradient
- Added .debug-status for status effects display
- Added .debug-mechanic styling
- Added pointer-events:none to .debug-panel to prevent blocking clicks
- Validated via Playwright: data-player-id, data-hp, data-x, data-y attrs present
- Validated: position updates on WASD movement, HP updates on damage
- Validated: health bar width matches HP% (e.g., 75HP = 75% width)
- Validated: mechanic attrs (data-mechanic-id, data-type, data-expires) present
- Validated: mechanic removed from DOM after expiration
- Files: public/css/style.css

## EVENT-001 - onStateChange callback in __gameTest API
- Added stateChangeCallbacks Set and onStateChange(callback) function to game.ts
- Callback receives full GameState on every server state update
- Returns unsubscribe function that removes callback from Set
- Multiple callbacks supported via Set
- notifyStateChange() called in socket 'state' handler
- Added onStateChange to __gameTest API
- Validated: callback fires with valid GameState (players, mechanics, statusEffects, timestamp)
- Validated: unsubscribe stops callbacks, multiple callbacks work
- Files: src/client/game.ts

## EVENT-002 - onMechanicSpawn callback in __gameTest API
- Added previousMechanicIds Set to track known mechanic IDs
- Added mechanicSpawnCallbacks Set and onMechanicSpawn(callback) function
- checkMechanicSpawns() called before state update, compares current vs previous IDs
- Callback fires only for mechanics with new IDs (not in previous state)
- Returns unsubscribe function that removes callback from Set
- Added onMechanicSpawn to __gameTest API
- Validated: callback fires with MechanicState (id, type, x, y, radius, startTime, endTime)
- Validated: unsubscribe stops callbacks, only fires for new mechanics
- Files: src/client/game.ts

## EVENT-003 - onMechanicResolve callback in __gameTest API
- Added mechanicResolveCallbacks Set and onMechanicResolve(callback) function
- Extended checkMechanicSpawns() to detect resolved mechanics (in previous, not in current)
- Callback receives mechanic id string when mechanic disappears from game state
- Returns unsubscribe function that removes callback from Set
- Added onMechanicResolve to __gameTest API
- Validated: callback fires with mechanic id string after chariot expires (~3s)
- Validated: unsubscribe stops callbacks
- Files: src/client/game.ts

## EVENT-004 - waitForMechanicResolve(mechanicId) in __gameTest API
- Added waitForMechanicResolve(mechanicId) function returning Promise<void>
- If mechanic doesn't exist in currentGameState, resolves immediately
- Otherwise subscribes to onMechanicResolve, resolves when matching id fires
- Auto-unsubscribes after resolution
- Added to __gameTest API
- Validated: nonexistent id resolves in 0ms
- Validated: chariot id waits ~3s then resolves
- Files: src/client/game.ts
