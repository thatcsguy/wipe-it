STATUS-001: COMPLETE
- Added StatusEffectType union w/ 'vulnerability'
- Added StatusEffectState interface (type, iconPath, startTime, duration, playerId)
- Added statusEffects[] to PlayerState, GameState
- Added Effect type w/ damage and status variants
- Updated player.ts toState(), game.ts broadcast(), client/game.ts default state
Files: src/shared/types.ts, src/server/player.ts, src/server/game.ts, src/client/game.ts

STATUS-002: COMPLETE
- Created StatusEffect class w/ properties: id, type, playerId, startTime, duration, ongoingEffects, expirationEffects
- tick() applies ongoing effects to player
- isExpired() checks now >= startTime + duration
- onExpire() applies expiration effects
- toState() returns StatusEffectState w/ iconPath from STATUS_ICONS lookup
Files: src/server/statusEffect.ts

STATUS-003: COMPLETE
- Created StatusEffectManager class w/ Map<string, StatusEffect> storage
- add(status) stores StatusEffect by id
- tick(now, players) iterates statuses, applies ongoing effects, removes expired (calls onExpire first)
- getStates() returns StatusEffectState[] for broadcast
- remove(id) deletes status by id
- Added helper getStatusesForPlayer(playerId) for STATUS-005 vulnerability check
Files: src/server/statusEffectManager.ts

STATUS-004: COMPLETE
- Added statusEffectManager property to Game class
- tick() now calls statusEffectManager.tick(now, this.players)
- broadcast() includes statusEffectManager.getStates() in state
- Verified w/ Playwright: game state has statusEffects array
Files: src/server/game.ts

STATUS-005: COMPLETE
- Player.takeDamage() checks for vulnerability via statusEffectManager.getStatusesForPlayer()
- Damage multiplied by 10 when vulnerability active
- Player has setStatusEffectManager() method, called in Game.addPlayer()
- Added getStatusEffectManager() and getPlayers() to Game for testing/future use
- Added admin:applyVulnerability socket event for testing
- Verified w/ Playwright: player took 250 dmg (25*10) with vuln vs 25 without
