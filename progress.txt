TOWER-001 (types) - DONE
- Added 'tower' to MechanicType union
- Created TowerMechanicState interface with all required fields
- Created TowerResolutionEvent interface with x,y for explosion positioning
- Added TowerMechanicState to MechanicState union
- File: src/shared/types.ts
- Build passes

TOWER-002 (server) - DONE
- Created src/server/mechanics/tower.ts implementing BaseMechanic
- Constructor takes all params: id, x, y, radius, startTime, endTime, requiredPlayers, failureEffects, successEffects
- tick() empty, isExpired() checks now >= endTime
- resolve() counts players in radius, applies successEffects to inside players if met, failureEffects to ALL players if not
- Returns TowerResolutionEvent with mechanicId, success, playersInside, required, x, y
- Updated types.ts to include TowerResolutionEvent in MechanicResolutionResult union
- Files: src/server/mechanics/tower.ts, src/server/mechanics/types.ts
- Build passes

TOWER-003 (server integration) - DONE
- Imported TowerMechanic in src/server/game.ts
- Added spawnTower(x, y, radius, duration, requiredPlayers, failureEffects, successEffects) method
- spawnTower generates unique id, calculates startTime/endTime from now + duration
- Updated resolution callback to detect TowerResolutionEvent (via 'required' field) and emit 'tower:resolved'
- TowerMechanic already exported from tower.ts
- File: src/server/game.ts
- Build passes

TOWER-004 (client colors) - DONE
- Added TOWER_COLOR = '#ffaa00' (yellow-orange)
- Added TOWER_FILL_ALPHA = 0.3
- Added TOWER_STROKE_ALPHA = 0.8
- All three exported
- File: src/client/mechanics/shared.ts
- Build passes

TOWER-005 (tower renderer) - DONE
- Created src/client/mechanics/tower.ts with renderTower function
- Draws outer circle with TOWER_COLOR, semi-transparent fill (0.3 alpha), solid stroke (0.8 alpha)
- 6 rotating tick marks (triangles) around perimeter, rotation uses serverTime * 0.002
- Large centered number showing requiredPlayers, ~45% of radius font size
- Number has white fill with black stroke outline for readability
- File: src/client/mechanics/tower.ts
- Build passes

TOWER-006 (tower explosion) - DONE
- Created src/client/mechanics/towerExplosion.ts
- Module maintains array of active explosions: { centerX, centerY, startTime }[]
- addTowerExplosion(x, y, serverTime) adds new explosion
- renderTowerExplosions(ctx, serverTime) draws expanding rings
- Ring expands to 1000px over 500ms, 20px stroke width
- Red/orange color (rgba 255,100,0), alpha fades linearly as ring expands
- Old explosions auto-removed after 500ms
- clearExplosions() for cleanup
- File: src/client/mechanics/towerExplosion.ts
- Build passes
