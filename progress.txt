## ROOT-001 + ROOT-003: Add rooted type and icon mapping

- Added 'rooted' to StatusEffectType union in src/shared/types.ts
- Added rooted icon path to STATUS_ICONS in src/server/statusEffect.ts
- Combined because STATUS_ICONS is Record<StatusEffectType, string> - requires all types

Files: src/shared/types.ts, src/server/statusEffect.ts

Note: ROOT-002 (asset download) still needed before icon displays

## ROOT-002: Download rooted icon asset

- Downloaded bind icon from FFXIV wiki to public/assets/rooted_icon.png
- Verified: valid PNG 24x32 RGBA, loads at localhost:3000/assets/rooted_icon.png

Files: public/assets/rooted_icon.png

## ROOT-004 + ROOT-005: Server-side rooted movement block + knockback immunity

- processInput(): after knockback check, return early if player has 'rooted' status (skips WASD)
- applyKnockback(): at start, return early if player has 'rooted' status (immune)
- Added admin:applyStatus socket handler for testing status effects
- Added __adminTest.emitApplyStatus() client helper
- Verified via Playwright: WASD blocked while rooted, knockback blocked, movement restored after expiry

Files: src/server/player.ts, src/server/index.ts, src/client/admin.ts
