TOWER-001 (types) - DONE
- Added 'tower' to MechanicType union
- Created TowerMechanicState interface with all required fields
- Created TowerResolutionEvent interface with x,y for explosion positioning
- Added TowerMechanicState to MechanicState union
- File: src/shared/types.ts
- Build passes

TOWER-002 (server) - DONE
- Created src/server/mechanics/tower.ts implementing BaseMechanic
- Constructor takes all params: id, x, y, radius, startTime, endTime, requiredPlayers, failureEffects, successEffects
- tick() empty, isExpired() checks now >= endTime
- resolve() counts players in radius, applies successEffects to inside players if met, failureEffects to ALL players if not
- Returns TowerResolutionEvent with mechanicId, success, playersInside, required, x, y
- Updated types.ts to include TowerResolutionEvent in MechanicResolutionResult union
- Files: src/server/mechanics/tower.ts, src/server/mechanics/types.ts
- Build passes

TOWER-003 (server integration) - DONE
- Imported TowerMechanic in src/server/game.ts
- Added spawnTower(x, y, radius, duration, requiredPlayers, failureEffects, successEffects) method
- spawnTower generates unique id, calculates startTime/endTime from now + duration
- Updated resolution callback to detect TowerResolutionEvent (via 'required' field) and emit 'tower:resolved'
- TowerMechanic already exported from tower.ts
- File: src/server/game.ts
- Build passes

TOWER-004 (client colors) - DONE
- Added TOWER_COLOR = '#ffaa00' (yellow-orange)
- Added TOWER_FILL_ALPHA = 0.3
- Added TOWER_STROKE_ALPHA = 0.8
- All three exported
- File: src/client/mechanics/shared.ts
- Build passes

TOWER-005 (tower renderer) - DONE
- Created src/client/mechanics/tower.ts with renderTower function
- Draws outer circle with TOWER_COLOR, semi-transparent fill (0.3 alpha), solid stroke (0.8 alpha)
- 6 rotating tick marks (triangles) around perimeter, rotation uses serverTime * 0.002
- Large centered number showing requiredPlayers, ~45% of radius font size
- Number has white fill with black stroke outline for readability
- File: src/client/mechanics/tower.ts
- Build passes

TOWER-006 (tower explosion) - DONE
- Created src/client/mechanics/towerExplosion.ts
- Module maintains array of active explosions: { centerX, centerY, startTime }[]
- addTowerExplosion(x, y, serverTime) adds new explosion
- renderTowerExplosions(ctx, serverTime) draws expanding rings
- Ring expands to 1000px over 500ms, 20px stroke width
- Red/orange color (rgba 255,100,0), alpha fades linearly as ring expands
- Old explosions auto-removed after 500ms
- clearExplosions() for cleanup
- File: src/client/mechanics/towerExplosion.ts
- Build passes

TOWER-007 (client integration) - DONE
- Imported renderTower from './tower'
- Added 'tower' case to renderMechanics dispatcher
- File: src/client/mechanics/index.ts
- Build passes

TOWER-008 (explosion rendering integration) - DONE
- Imported renderTowerExplosions from './mechanics/towerExplosion'
- Called renderTowerExplosions(ctx, serverTime) after status effects, before ctx.restore()
- Explosions render on top of all game elements
- File: src/client/renderer.ts
- Build passes

TOWER-009 (tower:resolved listener) - DONE
- Added tower:resolved Socket.IO listener in game.ts (alongside tether:resolved)
- Imported addTowerExplosion from './mechanics/towerExplosion'
- Imported TowerResolutionEvent from shared types
- On tower:resolved, if success is false, calls addTowerExplosion(event.x, event.y, currentGameState.timestamp)
- TowerResolutionEvent already has x,y from TOWER-001
- File: src/client/game.ts
- Build passes

TOWER-010 (admin panel) - DONE
- Added #spawn-tower-btn button to HTML admin panel
- Added click handler in admin.ts emitting 'admin:spawnTower'
- Added __adminTest.emitSpawnTower() for testing
- Server handles admin:spawnTower in index.ts, spawns tower at center (500,500), radius 80, 5s duration, requires 2 players
- failureEffects: 50 damage, successEffects: empty
- Playwright verified: button exists, tower spawns, failure damage applied (100->50 HP)
- Files: public/index.html, src/client/admin.ts, src/server/index.ts
- Build passes

TOWER-011 (debug panel) - DONE
- Added TowerMechanicState import to debugPanel.ts
- Added else-if branch for tower type in updateMechanicsSection
- Sets data-required-players attribute with tower.requiredPlayers value
- Playwright verified: .debug-mechanic[data-type="tower"] has data-required-players="2"
- File: src/client/debugPanel.ts
- Build passes

TOWER-012 (integration - render verification) - DONE
- Playwright verified tower visual rendering
- Navigated to localhost:3000?debug=1, joined game, clicked #spawn-tower-btn
- Verified .debug-mechanic[data-type="tower"] exists with data-required-players="2"
- Screenshot confirms visual: yellow-orange circle, 6 rotating triangular tick marks, large "2" in center
- Number has white fill with black outline for readability
- Mechanics render below players (correct z-order)

TOWER-013 (integration - failure verification) - DONE
- Playwright verified tower failure behavior with single player
- Spawned tower requiring 2 players, only 1 player in game
- Waited 6 seconds for tower to expire
- Verified tower mechanic element gone from debug panel
- Verified player HP decreased from 100 to 50 (failureEffects applied)
- Combat log shows "Player 1 took 50 damage"
- No code changes needed - test-only verification
