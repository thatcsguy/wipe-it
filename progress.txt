## ROOT-001 + ROOT-003: Add rooted type and icon mapping

- Added 'rooted' to StatusEffectType union in src/shared/types.ts
- Added rooted icon path to STATUS_ICONS in src/server/statusEffect.ts
- Combined because STATUS_ICONS is Record<StatusEffectType, string> - requires all types

Files: src/shared/types.ts, src/server/statusEffect.ts

Note: ROOT-002 (asset download) still needed before icon displays

## ROOT-002: Download rooted icon asset

- Downloaded bind icon from FFXIV wiki to public/assets/rooted_icon.png
- Verified: valid PNG 24x32 RGBA, loads at localhost:3000/assets/rooted_icon.png

Files: public/assets/rooted_icon.png

## ROOT-004 + ROOT-005: Server-side rooted movement block + knockback immunity

- processInput(): after knockback check, return early if player has 'rooted' status (skips WASD)
- applyKnockback(): at start, return early if player has 'rooted' status (immune)
- Added admin:applyStatus socket handler for testing status effects
- Added __adminTest.emitApplyStatus() client helper
- Verified via Playwright: WASD blocked while rooted, knockback blocked, movement restored after expiry

Files: src/server/player.ts, src/server/index.ts, src/client/admin.ts

## ROOT-006/007/008/009: Client-side rooted input blocking

- Created src/client/localStatus.ts: tracks local player status effects
  - setLocalPlayerId(id): set local player for filtering
  - updateLocalStatuses(statuses): sync from server state
  - isRooted(): returns true if local player has rooted status
- game.ts: call setLocalPlayerId on join, updateLocalStatuses in state handler
- network.ts applyInput(): after knockback check, return early if isRooted()
- network.ts reconcile(): after knockback block, skip input replay if isRooted()
- Follows knockback pattern for client-side movement blocking
- Verified via Playwright: movement blocked while rooted, restored after expiry

Files: src/client/localStatus.ts, src/client/game.ts, src/client/network.ts

## ROOT-010/011/012: Integration tests verified

- Fixed admin:applyStatus handler to default playerId to socket.id if not provided
- ROOT-010: Rooted blocks WASD movement, icon displays in debug panel
- ROOT-011: Rooted grants knockback immunity (radial knockback has no effect)
- ROOT-012: Rooted expires correctly, movement resumes after expiration
- All verified via Playwright with held key inputs (keyboard.down/up)

Files: src/server/index.ts, src/client/admin.ts
